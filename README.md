# Roofoo’s PD2 Loot Filter

**Edited and maintained by:**  
- [Enpherno](https://twitch.tv/Enpherno)  
- [RoofooEvazan](https://twitch.tv/RoofooEvazan)

A selectively customized fork of **[Kryszard](https://twitch.tv/Kryszard)’s Project Diablo 2 loot filter**.

This filter preserves Kryszard’s original structure and philosophy while adding **targeted late-game refinements**, stricter **FL7+/FL8+ filtering**, reduced ground clutter, and clearer base and quality visibility for end-game farming and mapping.

All changes are incremental and intentional, designed to enhance high-level play without sacrificing the clarity, information density, or reliability of the original filter.

👉 **Full credit to Kryszard** for the base loot filter.

---

### 🎚 FILTER LEVEL 8 (STRICT)
**Armor**
12.1.1
- Hide all magic & rare non-class shields (including eth)
- Hide all magic boots, gloves, and belts (including eth)

12.1.2
- Hide all normal and exceptional armor bases excluding Gothic Plate and Linked Mail (including eth) **To be assessed further, may adjust in future versions**
- Hide all non-magic and superior elite armor bases with less than 10% enhanced defense (including eth)
  
12.1.5
- Enforced FL8 hide rules for elite armor bases consistently outside of town, ensuring sub-10% enhanced defense bases no longer bypass strict filtering
- Prevented generic armor formatting passes from re-exposing armor bases intended to be hidden at FL8
- Normalized FL8 armor behavior to apply only outside of town, matching intended strictness design

**Weapons**
12.1.1
- Hide all non-magic, non-superior non-staff weapons
- Hide all non-magic, non-superior non-class bases
- Hide non-magic Phase Blades
- Hide non-magic dagger bases
- Hide magic daggers and javelins (including eth)

- Enforced strict FL8 hide behavior for all one-handed sword bases outside of town unless explicitly whitelisted
(includes Crystal Sword, Broad Sword, Long Sword, War Sword, Rune Sword, Battle Sword, and all exceptional/elite equivalents)
- Phase Blade handling is under active refinement
- Groundwork has been implemented to restrict Phase Blades to display only when meeting explicit enhanced damage and socket criteria
- Current status: Phase Blade visibility on FL8 may still be inconsistent in certain cases and is not yet considered final
- Prevented generic WEAPON / 1H rules from unintentionally allowing non-approved sword bases to appear on FL8
- Corrected FL8 evaluation order to ensure non-magic and superior weapon bases are fully hidden unless explicitly allowed
- Closed edge cases where valid hide rules were previously bypassed due to rule ordering or %CONTINUE% behavior
Note: Several of these weapon bases were implicitly visible prior to 12.1.5 due to broader weapon rules matching earlier than FL8 hides.
This version makes those hides deterministic. Phase Blade logic remains a known work in progress.
